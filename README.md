Compx241-21A codes
Hello there!

In this repo, we have the project folders. They contain the main menu project and the 3 minigame projects where the code can be inspected upon.

NOTE: If cloning (downloading the files), the project files CANNOT be debugged because the packages get messed up. 

However, the "Pub Quiz Buster!" folder contains the necessary files to run the program (including the exe file as if you were debugging).

There is a handy shortcut for our program in this folder as well.
You DO NOT need to download any MP4 files for Music Bingo if you select the '1980-1989' decade.

Also, we have a few snapshots of the tables in the database which we used to query data for the minigame projects.
Finally, our logo, icon and title screen images are here as well.

Thank you and hope you enjoy!
